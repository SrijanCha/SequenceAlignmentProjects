# README

In this repository are two large projects in DNA Sequence analysis that was completed over the course of the last two years (2022-2023). DNA Sequence Alignment is an important field of research. It not only has an important academic implications but also has significant economic impacts due to its usage in the biotech industry.

It is my hope to use these two projects (and more to come) to further my interest and experience in bioinformatics, data science, and programming. In the future, I want to expand on these projects by creating and implementing more efficient algorithms and perform differential expression analysis on various kinds of experimental data.

### LocalAlignment
The LocalAlignment Directory contains a program in python that attempts to create a modified Aho-Corasick structure to detect string patterns (reads) in genome sequences. Included are the script's input and output files.


### SequenceAndReadAnalysis
The SequenceAndReadAnalysis Directory contains several programs (all in python) that creates a local alignment between a set of reads and a genome using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. Additional axilliary programs, and input/output files from the script are included.
